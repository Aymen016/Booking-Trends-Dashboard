## üéØ Objectives
The main goal of this project was to analyze hotel booking data and extract meaningful insights by:
- Determining the total number of cancelled bookings.
- Understanding the types of guests who are more likely to cancel bookings versus those who complete their stays.
- Comparing total bookings and cancelled bookings between two different types of hotels.

## üßπ Data Cleaning & Analysis
Before visualizing the data, extensive data cleaning and preparation were done. Key steps included:
- Handling missing values and outliers.
- Filtering relevant data for analysis.
- Aggregating data based on key attributes such as guest types, hotel types, and booking status.

## üìä Power BI Dashboard
The final deliverable of this project is an interactive Power BI dashboard. The dashboard provides:
- A comprehensive view of total bookings and cancellations across hotel types.
- Analysis of guest types and their cancellation patterns.
- A responsive layout that adapts to both desktop and mobile devices.
